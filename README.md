# simply-chat
This is a simple real time chat client I built to show you some of the functionalities you can achieve with MeteorJS with a few lines of code. This was my first try at Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/)

This example is based on an existing example but I added/improved the following functionality:
- CSS improvements
- 'is typing' functionality
- show online users
- automatically slides down to a new message

These packages were required: 
<br> <b>meteor add mizzao:user-status</b>
<br> <b>meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password</b>
<br> <b>meteor add momentjs:moment</b>
<br> <b>meteor add mrt:moment-timezone </b>
<br> <b>meteor add jquery</b>
<br><br>

Setup:  <br>
sudo git clone https://github.com/nweat/simply-chat <br>
cd simply-chat/ <br>
sudo meteor 

<br><br>
Feel free to extend its functionality...
