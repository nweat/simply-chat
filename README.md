# simply-chat
This is a simple real time chat client I built to show you some of the functionalities you can achieve with MeteorJS with a few lines of code. This was my first try at Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/)

This example is based on an existing example but I added/improved the following functionality:
- CSS improvements
- 'is typing' functionality
- show online users
- automatically slides down to a new message

These packages are required: 
<br> <b>meteor add mizzao:user-status</b>
meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password
meteor add momentjs:moment
meteor add mrt:moment-timezone 
meteor add jquery

Feel free to extend its functionality...
