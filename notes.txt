This is just a simple app I built to show you some of the functionalities you can achieve with MeteorJS with little code. 

This was based on an existing example but I added the following functionality:
- CSS improvements
- 'is typing' functionality
- show online users
- automatically slides down when you receive a new message

http://momentjs.com/timezone/

These packages are required:
meteor add momentjs:moment
meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password
meteor add mrt:moment-timezone 
meteor add mizzao:user-status
meteor add jquery

Feel free to reuse and extend its functionality...
